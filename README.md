# Encounter Creator S2G3

Installation and activation of a venv (not required but I recommend it): https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/installation/

Tutorial this is based on: https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/tutorial/

IMPORTANT PAGE you will need to read before you will be able to run the server: https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/tutorial/factory/#run-the-application

You also need to install the requirements using something like this command: python -m pip install -r requirements.txt

Running should be as easy as 'flask run' once everything is set up
